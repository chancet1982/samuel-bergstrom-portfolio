----- TODO list (What's left before you're done) -----
SECTION_ELEMENTS.CASE_THUMBNAIL -> Go through all cases and make sure that there is a good thumbnail for desktop and mobile (1024\*1024)
CASE_03 -> Better thumbnail image,
CASE_02 -> Better thumbnail image, Better hero image
CASE_01 -> Better thumbnail image, Better hero image
SECTION_HERO -> Add support for background image to have same effect as blockquote background image
KEY_FIGURES -> doesnt scale on mobile nicely
SNEAKPEEK? -> doesnt look nice on mobile

----- ONCE DONE -----
CASE_07 -> Add pictures of the report.
RESULT -> Add support for mobile (like in cover images)
Check the site on mobile and do whatever it takes to get it working.
SECTION_ELEMENTS.CASE_THUMBNAILS -> Mobile is not implemented.
Check -> left alignment on mobile and desktop
SECTION_IMAGE: add support for parallax effect (can be nice to have on non-content-critical images)
Consider using a more consitent color scheme 3 colors or so (pastels)

----- OLD FIXES (NOT SURE IF RELEVANT ANYMORE) -----
ADDITIONAL_CASES -> Fix design of cases to work with 3 column layout. Fix title misalignment
CaseThumbnail -> Fix better tag for COMING SOON cases.
LANDING_PAGE -> Is light is not working (because section has a background color so it overrides the element color context)
MOBILE_MENU -> Implement staggered menulink animations.
SECTION_IMAGE: make selectable if you want it to scale down or preserve height

----- CONTENT CLEANUP: -----
case-8 -> FINISH OR REMOVE!
case-6 -> FINISH OR REMOVE!
SECTION_ELEMENTS.OVERVIEW -> Most likely not in use (other than in old, unfinished cases. Clean up old cases and remove. )

One day...
Use Contentful for content.
server side rendering using Next.js (?)
Add password protection to cases
cleanup limitMaxWidth & bgColor props to be used only where relevant
COVER_CAPTION: Add "back" button (In cases)

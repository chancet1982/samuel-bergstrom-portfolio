Just updating todo
FIXES:

Fix vertical alignment - mobile
ADDITIONAL_CASES (mobile) -> Fix height
CASES (mobile) -> Fix text width

Cases -> Padding under text shouldnt be there...

FEATURES & IMPROVEMENTS:
COVER_CAPTION: Add "back" button
ABOUT ME -> Fix smaller images to use circular image and cliping path instead.
TESTIMONIALS -> Looks rather bland. perhaps needs some love.
ListOfImagesWithTitleAndText -> add support for background color on items only. not entire list.
ListOfImagesWithTitleAndText -> goes to single column too soon. should keep have columns on tablets too.

Add password protection to cases
cleanup limitMaxWidth & bgColor props to be used only where relevant

ANIMATIONS:
Social media links -> Add inView animations

case-7 -> Add pictures of the report?
case-6 -> Go through and rewrite

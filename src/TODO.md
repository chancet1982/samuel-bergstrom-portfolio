TODO list (What's left before you're done)

NOW:
Change read more to be "button" instead of "link"
ListOfImageWithTitleAndText -> add support for padding-bottom.

Mobile fixes:
Image gallery images overflow the screen area on smaller screens.
Pick up only 3 testimonials instead of the entire list on mobile
Add support for quote to have a background image.
Hide navigation while screen animation is playing. (nice to have)
Add secondary button and use that layout in the preview for landing page cases and about me text.

Navbar doesnt look good on pixel 2 landspace.

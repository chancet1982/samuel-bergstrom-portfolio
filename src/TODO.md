TODO list (What's left before you're done)

FIXES:
CaseThumbnail -> Fix better tag for COMING SOON cases.
Look at components and vertical rythem (it should be okey on component level but on section level might need some love).

NAVIGATION -> Navigation gets wrong bgColor when leaving a page with COVER when COVER is not in viewport.
Fix vertical alignment - mobile
ADDITIONAL_CASES (mobile) -> Fix height

ANIMATIONS:
ListOfOmageWithTitleAndText -> add inView animation to images.

CONTENT:
case-9 -> mobile cover image is missing
case-7 -> Add pictures of the report?
case-6 -> Go through and rewrite
case-8 -> Go through and rewrite
CASE-4 -> Make a better flow image (flows.png)
CASE-1 -> Fix better images so it works on mobile

One day...
Use Contentful for content.
server side rendering using Next.js (?)
Add password protection to cases
cleanup limitMaxWidth & bgColor props to be used only where relevant
COVER_CAPTION: Add "back" button (In cases)

TODO list (What's left before you're done)
Mobile links are not working.
SECTION_ELEMENTS.OVERVIEW -> Most likely not in use (other than in old, unfinished cases. Clean up old cases and remove. )
SECTION_HERO -> Add support for background image to have same effect as blockquote background image
SECTION_ELEMENTS.CASE_THUMBNAIL -> Update case thumbnails to use new image aspect ratio (1600 \* 1080)

CASE_10 -> Better result picture (figure out what to do about the height)
CASE_10 -> Add image of the final result
CASE_09 -> Better result picture
CASE_09 -> use quote with image background of the excel sheet in the background but blurred.
CASE_07 -> Better hero image
CASE_07 -> Add pictures of the report.
CASE_05 -> Better hero image
CASE_04 -> Better hero image
CASE_03 -> Better hero image
CASE_02 -> Better hero image
CASE_01 -> Better hero image

FIXES:
LANDING_PAGE -> Is light is not working (because section has a background color so it overrides the element color context)
MOBILE_MENU -> Implement staggered menulink animations.
CaseThumbnail -> Fix better tag for COMING SOON cases.
SECTION_IMAGE: make selectable if you want it to scale down or preserve height
CASE_THUMBNAILS -> Mobile is not implemented.
ADDITIONAL_CASES -> Fix design of cases to work with 3 column layout. Fix title misalignment
NOTE -> fix left alignment

CONTENT:
case-8 -> FINISH ME!
case-6 -> FINISH ME!
CASE-1 -> Fix better images so it works on mobile

One day...

----- TODO list (What's left before you're done) -----

- CASE_THUMBNAIL: Fix thumbnail height on mobile when using bgImage
- SECTION_HERO_CASES: make isScaleOnScroll selectable.
- SECTION_HERO: make sure it uses background wrapper instead of current solution.
- IMAGE_WITH_TITLE_AND_TEXT_2: Better mobile version.
- SECTION_IMAGE: add support for parallax effect (can be nice to have on non-content-critical images)
- SECTION_IMAGE: make it nicer on mobile
- Update design of "about me" and remove testimonials and client logos from page. Update to be more of a story/timeline instead of CV (POTENTIALLY COPY THE EFFECT FROM GITHUB)
- Primary button text color should be white when hover.
- Limit splash screen to show only once.
- provide better styling for the success/error messages
- Contact me link -> make slide to contact form
- Footer bgColor does not impact the navBgColor (as it is fixed to the top atm)
- All CASE -> Add TLDR section (potentially repurpose the overview component)
- Better mobile thumbnails (now that we updated the thumbnail the mobile one looks funny)

----- Fixes for mobile version only -----
SNEAKPEEK? -> Create alternate design for mobile phones only
RESULT -> Check if "sticky" is working as it should (CASE_10, CASE_7, CASE_5, CASE_4, CASE_3, CASE_2, CASE_1 not working but CASE_9 does)
Check the site on mobile and do whatever it takes to get it working.

----- ONE DAY -----
Add support for Google Analytics + Google tag manager.
Add bottom navigation in footer
Better response after sending an email (instead of generic "thanks")
CASE_07 -> Add pictures of the report.
COVER_CAPTION: Add "back" button (In cases)
Add password protection to cases
server side rendering using Next.js (?)
Use Contentful for content.

Removed these but might be worth keeping in mind:
nanoclone
lottie-react
@splinetool/react-spline
@splinetool/runtime

TODO list (What's left before you're done)

NOW:
Change read more to be "button" instead of "link"
ListOfImageWithTitleAndText -> add support for padding-bottom.

Mobile fixes:
Image gallery images overflow the screen area on smaller screens.
Case thumbnails on mobile should start at their "hovered" state.
Pick up only 3 testimonials instead of the entire list on mobile
Add support for quote to have a background image.
Hide navigation while screen animation is playing. (nice to have)
Add secondary button and use that layout in the preview for landing page cases and about me text.

LATER:
Improve the design on KeyFigures.
Clean up the components and sort to ELEMENTS and SECTION_ELEMENTS (EVERYTHING THAT CANNOT BE RENDERED USING THE ELEMENTS RENDERER SHOULD BE IN ELEMENTS)
Generalize background colors on TEXTBOX, LISTOFIMAGES, KEYFIGURES, QUOTE with a wrapper component.

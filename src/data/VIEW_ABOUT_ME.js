                I'm a digital product designer, Accessibility nerd, A father,
                husband, and quite a nice guy. Or at least a semi-decent human
                being. During the last 13 years I've worked with many companies
                operation in a wide array of domains. To name a few: Finance,
                healthcare, and e-commerece.

              <Paragraph>
                I believe in creating <strong>practical designs</strong>.
                Designs that are fast to implement, easy to use, and are scaled
                to fit. That requires more than just knowing what looks nice. It
                requires a deeper understanding of business and technology. From
                the business aspect of things, I believe that decisions need to
                be based on evidence, in lack of evidence, its simply guided by
                intuition and opinions. I believe that designers need to
                understand code (not write code) but at least understand the
                medium in which we operate. I write code (mostly React & Vue)
                not to be the best developer but because it forces me to drink
                my own soup. If I know how to develop it, im sure it would be
                impementable. On top of that, it helps me overcome the
                limitations of using typical prototyping tools.

              <Paragraph>
                When im not working I'm most likely chasing down my kids, trying
                to prevent the next disaster from happening at home. While not
                doing that, I make pizza... I love pizza, who doesnt? Well it is
                more of an obssession to be honest. It took over my life a
                couple of years ago and ive never looked back since. If that
                sounds like something you'd like come over, and let's talk over
                a warm slice of pizza and some cold beer

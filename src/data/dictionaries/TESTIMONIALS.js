        Sam is a very widely knowledgeable and competent UX designer, with a
        genuine focus and passion for user value. His long running experience
        with UX research helped the UX department elevate the current setup and
        execution, generating valuable insights that had a significant impact on
        the upcoming prioritised initiatives within the company. Besides his
        design chops Sam always brought a generous dose of humor and personality
        to work, which I really appreciated.

          Working closely with Sam at Prisjakt has been truly inspiring.
          Although I have 20 yrs experience I learned a lot from him. He has a
          structured data oriented approach to identify user and business needs
          and pain points. Being a developer, I also appreciate Sams knowledge
          in web development. It is valuable when working together to find good
          practical solutions.

          Samuel helped us at Fitness24Seven with a prestudy in October 2020.
          His role was to analyze customers’ and members’ needs from a user
          experience view. He did so with interviews, surveys and managed to put
          together a good material for our decision making. He also created a
          conceptual design, both based on his own findings but also a more
          visionary concept for our future.

          Samuel is a straight forward guy that is not shy to tell you what he
          thinks needs to be done and how it should be done. I really like it
          when a consultant nails the advising part of his role, which brings
          much value to the table. I enjoyed working with Samuel and the work he
          did ended up really good. I’m happy with the result and hope that we
          will work together again in the future.

        When we wanted to create a mobile application focused on our patients
        and their participation in their care we needed someone who could guide
        us towards the best user experience for them. We got the help from
        Samuel who made sure to put his heart and soul into understanding our
        patients and how they might come to use this application. With our
        patients in mind, Samuel took the lead as we created a rich and engaging
        user experience together. Samuel is very thorough, imaginative and easy
        to work with and we are very happy with the work he did for us.

        focus on end users. Samuel has many times impressed by finding the
        creative ways to conduct UX research even when there was no budget set
        aside for it in the project. He is fun to work with, and he brings
        energy to any group he works with.

          quality and impact of the work UX team is delivering in your

          Samuel helped us at Fitness24Seven with a prestudy in October 2020.
          His role was to analyze customers’ and members’ needs from a user
          experience view. He did so with interviews, surveys and managed to put
          together a good material for our decision making. He also created a
          conceptual design, both based on his own findings but also a more
          visionary concept for our future.

        <Paragraph>
          Samuel is a straight forward guy that is not shy to tell you what he
          thinks needs to be done and how it should be done. I really like it
          when a consultant nails the advising part of his role, which brings
          much value to the table. I enjoyed working with Samuel and the work he
          did ended up really good. I’m happy with the result and hope that we
          will work together again in the future.

          When we wanted to create a mobile application focused on our patients
          and their participation in their care we needed someone who could
          guide us towards the best user experience for them. We got the help
          from Samuel who made sure to put his heart and soul into understanding
          our patients and how they might come to use this application. With our
          patients in mind, Samuel took the lead as we created a rich and
          engaging user experience together. Samuel is very thorough,
          imaginative and easy to work with and we are very happy with the work
          he did for us.

          I had a privilege to work together with Samuel in several SW projects
          during a period of 2 years and also to be his manager for a part of
          this time. Samuel is solution oriented, pragmatic UX designer with
          fierce focus on end users. Samuel has many times impressed by finding
          the creative ways to conduct UX research even when there was no budget
          set aside for it in the project. He is fun to work with, and he brings
          energy to any group he works with.

          Sam is the kind of a person you need if you want to elevate the
          quality and impact of the work UX team is delivering in your
          organisation. One of his super powers is getting deep to the core of a
          problem and helping clients realise the greater potential of their
          business solution.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          He pairs it with an uncanny ability to talk design in the language of
          business— a rarity in our line of work—which is a key that unlocks the
          shortest path to success, with all stakeholders on board. Sam’s can-do
          attitude and willingness to explore new venues, where so often he
          takes all the risk for the investment, is contagious and greatly
          appreciated. He is a passionate evangelist of the value of UX, as well
          as a mentor and a coach to younger colleagues.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          All of this makes Sam a true leader and a team mate we couldn’t
          imagine our lives without. I am honoured and grateful for having him
          on my team.

          I had the pleasure of working with Sam at Fundconnect, collaborating
          on several project teams. Sam consistently demonstrated his excellent
          technical skills, great work ethic and his creative and efficient
          designs. Sam is dedicated, very capable and very helpful to give ideas
          and solutions. No matter how tense a meeting, Sam made sure everyone
          left with a smile. Any employee would be lucky to have Sam.

          leading by example demonstrated excellent work ethics and pragmatic
          approach in design while keeping users needs in focus. He is a very
          skilled UX designer, and has unsurpassed analytical thinking, ability
          to break down complex problems and is a great communicator with both
          developers project managers and other stakeholders. During the time we
          worked together, I’ve seen him succeed in tackling many complex
          projects, for numerous clients, and across multiple product lines. His
          sense of responsibility and duty are admirable.

          Samuel worked with Telescope as UX Designer for one of our customers.
          Samuel was a much appreciated colleague and a good friend who always
          showed up with a smile. During his time with Telescope he worked with
          a customer within E-Commerce and was much appreciated for his
          knowledge and determination to get the tasks done in time and to
          perform 100% in the projects. With Samuels background and experience
          he is will be the backbone in any project.

        Samuel is a straight forward guy that is not shy to tell you what he
        thinks needs to be done and how it should be done. I really like it when
        a consultant nails the advising part of his role, which brings much
        value to the table. I enjoyed working with Samuel and the work he did
        ended up really good. Iâ€™m happy with the result and hope that we will
        work together again in the future.
